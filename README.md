# Projects from the 'Embedded C for Microcontrollers' Course 

This course was completed in 2021 at Imperial College London as part of a MEng Mechanical Engineering with a Year Abroad degree. 

Final grade for this course was 75.00%, equivelent to a First Class or 4.0 GPA. 



## Street Light Control 
This was an individual midterm project to create a control system for streetlights which would automatically turn on and off based off specified conditions. The controls also factored in daylight savings and could determine the expected sunrise and sunset and adapt accordingly. 

## Final Project
### Controls for Robot Navigating based off Light Sensor Inputs
This was a final project, completed as a pair with Archie Platt. This project was creating a control system to successfully navigate a robot through a maze based off 'reading' coloured signs using a light sensor.
